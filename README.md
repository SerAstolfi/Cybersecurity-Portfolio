## 📌 Introduction
Welcome to my technical portfolio. 
This repository documents my journey and practical work in **Cybersecurity Defense (Blue Teaming)**. 
Coming from a background in **Financial Trading**, I apply the same rigorous analytical methodology used in market data analysis to **Network Traffic Analysis**, **Log Review**, and **Anomaly Detection**.

My goal is to demonstrate practical competency in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security threats using industry-standard TTPs.

## 🛠️ Technical Skill Set

| Category | Tools & Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Network Analysis** | Wireshark, TCPdump |
| **SIEM & Logs** | Splunk (Basics), ELK Stack, Sysmon |
| **Endpoint Security** | Windows Internals, Linux Hardening, basic EDR analysis |
| **Scripting** | Python (Data parsing), Bash, PowerShell |
| **Frameworks** | MITRE ATT&CK, NIST CSF, Cyber Kill Chain |

## 📂 Repository Structure

This portfolio is organized into specific operational domains. Click on the folders to view detailed write-ups and screenshots.

### 🔹 [Network Traffic Analysis](./Labs/Network_Analysis)
*Deep dive into PCAP files to identify malware communication, data exfiltration, and C2 channels.*

### 🔹 [SIEM & Log Analysis](./Labs/SIEM_Logs)
*Detection engineering exercises and log investigation scenarios.*
* **Highlighted Project:** SSH Brute Force detection via Splunk.

### 🔹 [Scripting & Automation](./Scripts)
*Custom tools developed to automate analysis and data extraction.*

## 📜 Methodology
All investigations in this portfolio follow a standard Incident Response lifecycle:
1.  **Detection:** Identification of the anomaly.
2.  **Analysis:** Technical breakdown (Packet/Process level).
3.  **Correlation:** Mapping to **MITRE ATT&CK** IDs.
4.  **Mitigation:** Proposed defense measures (Firewall rules, Snort signatures).
